// The one turn that is in flight, so a refresh does not lose it.
//
// `/api/chat` answers in the same response, so a tab that is refreshed or closed while
// the request is open never sees the reply. The user's message is already saved to the
// account before the call, so the thread comes back after a reload - with the user's
// turn and no answer, and nothing saying why.
//
// This keeps a small record of the turn while the request is open. On the next load the
// composer is filled with it again and the thread says it was not delivered.
//
// Deliberately NOT an automatic retry. A lost request may have been a GitHub write - a
// branch, a commit - and re-sending it on load would repeat that side effect without
// anyone asking. The user decides.
