/**
 * Sends one pending turn, off the screen's lifecycle.
 *
 * The send used to run in `rememberCoroutineScope()`, which is tied to the composition:
 * leaving the screen or backgrounding the app cancelled it, and the reply was lost. A
 * Worker belongs to the application, so the request finishes whether or not anyone is
 * looking at the chat.
 *
 * Two rules, both deliberate.
 *
 * **No automatic retry.** A failed turn returns `Result.failure()`, not `Result.retry()`.
 * A chat turn can be a GitHub write - a branch, a commit - and WorkManager retrying it
 * would repeat that side effect without anyone asking. The turn is marked failed, the
 * thread shows it with a retry button, and the user decides.
 *
 * **Text only.** A turn with attachments is not queued here: replaying it would need the
 * picked URIs and their persistable permissions, and a read that silently fails later is
 * worse than the composer restore that already covers that case.
